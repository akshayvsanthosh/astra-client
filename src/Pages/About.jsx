                    One evening, while taking a deep dive in Vembanad Lake, Maya was unexpectedly swept away by a powerful current. Unable to fight against it, she lost consciousness and sank deeper into the depths.

                    When she woke up, she found herself inside a mysterious, air-filled cave located deep underwater, surrounded by glowing crystals embedded in the caveâ€™s walls.

                    At the center was a particularly large crystal, radiating an otherworldly energy. As Maya reached out to touch it, the crystal pulsated and surged with energy, flowing through her body, transforming her mind and senses.

                    Emerging from the cave, Maya realized she had gained extraordinary abilities. Now reborn as Astra, she used her background in web development to create an online platform where people could anonymously submit grievances. With her powers, she secretly addressed these injustices, becoming a guardian.
